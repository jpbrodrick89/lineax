    factorisation costs what the solves it would save cost anyway (A100, float64,
    within 12% either way at n = 256 and n = 1024). For these four the determinant
    comes straight from the operator's entries -- a product of the diagonal, a
    three-term minor recurrence, or an FFT -- so differentiating it is O(n), or
    O(n log n) for `Circulant` and O(n**2) for `Triangular`, whose operator is a dense
    matrix in the first place. Against O(n**2) work *and memory* for the generic rule,
    which needs a 34GB tangent for a float64 tridiagonal operator at n = 65536 and
    simply runs out. Only add a solver here whose `init` and `slogdet` are pure JAX:
    `QR` would raise `NotImplementedError` for `geqrf`.

    differentiably, and `_slogdet_jvp` to decide whether to use that. They have to
    agree: the rule would otherwise differentiate a state that was stopped.
