# Determinants.
#
# Both implementations evaluate the same three-term recurrence on the leading
# principal minors D_i = det(A[:i+1, :i+1]):
#
#     D_i = d_i D_{i-1} - l_{i-1} u_{i-1} D_{i-2},      D_{-1} = 1, D_0 = d_0
#
# with det(A) = D_{n-1}. This is division-free, unlike the LU-pivot recurrence
# p_i = d_i - l_{i-1} u_{i-1} / p_{i-1}, which divides by zero as soon as any *leading*
# minor is singular -- even when A itself is invertible, e.g. [[0, 1], [1, 0]].
#
# They differ only in how the recurrence is associated:
#
#   * `_slogdet_scan` walks it in order, which is optimal on CPU.
#   * `_slogdet_tree_reduce` rewrites it as a product of 2x2 transfer matrices and
#     reassociates that product into a balanced tree, which is what GPUs need: there,
#     each
#     `lax.scan` iteration costs a kernel launch (~8us) whatever the work inside it,
#     so the sequential form costs ~8us * n / block: on an A100 in float64 that is 15x
#     slower at n = 512, 199x at n = 8192, and 3377x at n = 131072.
#
# Both names refer to how the product is associated, not to the JAX primitives used:
# the tree runs a short `lax.scan` within each chunk too. It is a reduction rather than
# a scan -- only the final product is wanted, not every prefix -- and it is built by an
# iterative loop over levels, not by recursion.
#
# `Tridiagonal.slogdet` picks between them with `lax.platform_dependent`. `lx.slogdet`'s
# JVP rule differentiates that, so each platform also reverses the implementation it
# uses for the primal, which is what you want on both. On GPU the tree's primal
# advantage decides it. On CPU the scan wins on both counts: in float64 at n = 8192 its
# primal is 85us against 171us, and its backward pass costs a further 1.4-1.8x against
# 3.9-12.3x for the tree (reversing a scan is a second serial pass over stored
# residuals; reversing a tree is another tree, but over much more data).
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Number of raw recurrence steps between renormalisations. Bigger blocks amortise the
# renormalisation over more steps; smaller blocks let the minors decay further before a
# block underflows. A block underflows once the minors decay past float range within
# it, i.e. roughly when R * K > 308 for an operator whose entries span 10**-R, so this
# caps the tolerated grading. The heuristic is accurate for K >= 8 and optimistic below
# it, where the tree's own ceiling near 68 decades binds first instead. At K = 4 both
# implementations land around 60 decades -- the exact figure moves by a few either way
# with the draw -- so the GPU path costs no tolerance relative to the scan.
#
# Past that limit neither path fails cleanly. A block's minors decay into the denormal
# range before the renormalisation sees them, losing precision but staying finite, so
# above the limit there is a band of R where the result is silently wrong rather than
# -inf: at K = 4, `_slogdet_scan` is wrong by up to 1.3e-3 relative in `lad` -- a factor
# of e**14 in |det| -- for R in 66..79 before underflowing at 80. This is inherent to
# renormalising in blocks and is not specific to K = 4: K = 2 has the same band, at
# roughly double the R.
#
# The binding quantity is the exponent range, so float32 divides every figure by about
# eight: at K = 4 the limit is 8 decades, silently wrong at 9, underflow from 10.
#
# 4 is the largest K whose limit clears the 40 decades that
# `test_tridiagonal_slogdet_graded` pins -- 8 drops it to 38 and fails outright -- and
# the smallest that beats LAPACK `gttrf` on CPU at every size (1.1-1.5x unbatched,
# 2.2-3.0x batched). It costs nothing on GPU, where the tree's launch count is
# `block + log_radix(n / block)` rather than `n / block`. `benchmarks/determinant_speeds
# .py` regenerates every figure quoted here.
_SLOGDET_BLOCK = 4

# Fan-in of the tree: how many chunk transfer matrices are multiplied together between
# renormalisations. Only `_slogdet_tree_reduce` has a tree, so this affects GPU only.
#
# On well-scaled operators the radix barely matters: 2 through 32 agree to within a
# factor of 6 in relative error, even on near-defective ones where the transfer
# matrices are close to rank one. What it does cost is grading tolerance, and there it
# is a cliff rather than a gradient, for the same reason `_SLOGDET_BLOCK` is -- a group
# spans `radix` times as many steps between renormalisations:
#
#     radix:            2     4     8    16    32
#     tolerated R:     66    66    44    26    18
#
# 4 is the largest radix that costs nothing: it holds whatever the block length allows,
# and beyond it the tolerance halves each time -- at 16, an operator
# whose entries merely span 30 decades already comes back non-finite. That is worth
# more than the ~15% 8 would buy (A100, float64, n = 131072: 65, 50, 43, 49, 53us of
# device time for 2, 4, 8, 16, 32; 8 is the fastest, 2 reliably the slowest, since
# fewer matrices per level means more levels and so more kernel launches).
#
# `benchmarks/determinant_speeds.py` regenerates all of this. Note when re-measuring
# that `jax.jit` caches on function identity, so a sweep that jits the same function
# object while mutating this constant silently measures the first setting every time.

    whole operator first uses det(A) = sigma**n det(A / sigma), i.e.
